# CS102-Git-Tutorial

  * This repository contains a tiny cipher program. Two people were involved in the development process. The first developer completed the task but thought it would be fun to replace some of the code with encoded text. Now the program is not working. The second developer, unfortunately, thought that it would be better to eliminate the syntax errors first by deleting the problematic code. This got rid of the errors, but the program is not doing what we want.

  * As our new developer, you should first **fork** this project to work on your own copy.

  * Then we advise you to roll back one version, as the code was easier to fix before the second developer was involved.

  * **Commit** and **push** the fixed version of the program to your repository.

  * Finally open a **pull request** to the original repository.
